| `JDParsing.py`         | Summarizes JDs and extracts key components like skills, qualifications, etc.    |
| `newmatric.py`         | Matches extracted resume data with JD and calculates match percentage           |

| `schedular.py`         | Generates interview slots and schedules interviews for selected candidates      |
